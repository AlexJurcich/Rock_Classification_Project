# Rock Classification Project

## Overview
This project applies various classification algorithms to predict rock categories (Igneous, Metamorphic, and Sedimentary) using 11 features from provided datasets. The goal is to explore classification methods such as Multinomial Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests. Hyperparameter tuning is conducted for each model to optimize performance.

## Key Tasks
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and statistical analysis
- **PCC Calculation**: Pearson Correlation Coefficient between features and labels
- **Classifier Training**: Multinomial Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forests
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search and manual tuning for optimal results
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combine classifiers to improve performance
- **Human Comparison**: Compare model accuracy with human predictions from trial data

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## Dataset
1. **aggregateRockData.xlsx**: Contains rock categories (labels).
2. **features_presence540.txt**: Contains 11 features used for classification.
